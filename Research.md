Definition of an AI Engineer:
AI engineers create, program, and train intricate networks of algorithms that enable AI to mimic human brain function.
Requires expertise in software development, programming, data science, and data engineering.
Unlike data engineers, AI engineers primarily locate and retrieve data, build and test machine learning models, and implement AI applications using API calls or embedded code. They rarely write code for scalable data sharing.
